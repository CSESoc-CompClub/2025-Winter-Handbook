# For Loops

A `for` loop repeats a block of code a known number of times. Itâ€™s commonly used when the number of iterations is known ahead of time.

```js
for (initialization; condition; final-expression) {
  // code block to be executed
}

// This loop prints numbers from 0 to 9:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
}
// Output:
// The number is 0
// The number is 1
// The number is 2
// The number is 3
// The number is 4
// The number is 5
// The number is 6
// The number is 7
// The number is 8
// The number is 9

// This loop prints even numbers up to 10:
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output:
// 0
// 2
// 4
// 6
// 8
// 10
```
