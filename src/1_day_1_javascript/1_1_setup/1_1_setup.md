# Part 1: Setting up your environment
Welcome to Day 1 of CompClub's winter workshops ☃️❄️!! Today you'll be putting all that you learnt
about JavaScript in the lecture slides into practice!

1. You should have two apps open - a web browser and visual studio code (vscode)
> [!TIP] Tip
> You can switch between these applications in the top left of your screen!
>

2. Click on `exercises.js` in visual studio code (has the blue icon)

3. Press the buttons `ctrl + s` to save the file. Make sure you save regularly as you work! Vscode tells you that you have unsaved changes when there is a **white dot** next to the file name, like so:
