# Part 2.2: Variables
> [!INFO] Declaring & Reassigning variables
> You can also create variables in javascript with their own **names**. These are used everywhere in programming
> to **store values**. Some variables can be changed later on as the context of your code changes. Refer to the [slides](https://go.compclub.org/winter-day-1) to see the main reasons they're used! 
> ```javascript
> // There are two main ways to declare a variable in javascript
> 
> // Constant variables
> const unchanging = 1;
> unchanging = 5; // will throw an error
> 
> // Mutable (changeable) variables
> // The name of the variable here is planet, and the value is "earth".
> let planet = "earth";
> planet = "jupiter";
> ```

> [!INFO] Printing variables
> You can print your variables with `console.log()`. You can combine this with reassigning variables
> to print different messages. 
> ```javascript
> let message = "Hello World!";
> console.log(message);
> 
> message = "I love CompClub!";
> console.log(message);
> ```

> [!QUESTION] Question
> There are some words you cannot use as variable names. Do you remember what these are?
> You can refer to the slides if you don't remember!


> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
> 1. Create two different types of variables with your own names and values
> 2. Print your variables to the console
> 3. Change the value of your variables and print them before and after the change
> 4. Run your file!
> 5. Make sure you save your code with `ctrl + s`!!
