# Part 2.1: Hello World!

> [!INFO] Comments
> Let's start by writing our very first comment! Comments are not run as code, and are instead
> used by programmers for you and others to **read** and **understand** your code easier.
> ```javascript
> // This is a single line comment!
> 
> /*
> This is
> a multiline
> comment!
> */
> ```

> [!INFO] Printing to the terminal
> How do we see what we're doing in code? Printing! In JavaScript we use `console.log()` to achieve this. 
> Just put whatever you want to print in between the brackets. Printing is useful for finding the cause of errors (also known as debugging 🐛) and for monitoring code execution.
> ```javascript
> // prints Hello World! to the terminal
> console.log("Hello World")
> 
> // prints 50 to the terminal
> console.log(50)
> ```

> [!TIP] Running your code
> 1. Open the terminal in vscode by pressing `` ctrl + ` `` or by looking at the top middle of vscode for the button that says **terminal** → **new terminal**
> 
> 2. Type the command `node exercises.js` in the terminal and press `enter`
> 
> 3. You should be able to see what you've printed!
> Ask a mentor if you're having trouble running your code.

> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
> 1. Write some comments in your `exercises.js` file
> 2. Print some things to the terminal using `console.log()`
> 3. Run your file!
