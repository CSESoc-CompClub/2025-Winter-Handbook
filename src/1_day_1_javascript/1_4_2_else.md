## else statement

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

```js
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

// if the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```
