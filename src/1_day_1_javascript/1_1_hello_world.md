# Part 2: Hello World!

> [!INFO] Comments
> Let's start by writing our very first comment! Comments are not run as code, and are instead
> used by programmers for you and others to **read** and **understand** your code easier.
> ```javascript
> // This is a single line comment!
> 
> /*
> This is
> a multiline
> comment!
> */
> ```

> [!TIP] Running your code
> Open the terminal in vscode by pressing ``ctrl + ` `` 
> 

> [!INFO] Declaring & Reassigning variables
> You can also create variables in javascript. These are used everywhere in programming
> to **store values**. Some variables can be changed later on as the context of your code changes. Refer to the [slides](https://go.compclub.org/winter-day-1) to see the main reasons they're used! 
> ```javascript
> // There are two main ways to declare a variable in javascript
> 
> // Constant variables
> const unchanging = 1 
> unchanging = 5  // will throw an error
>
> // Mutable (changeable) variables
> let planet = "earth"
> planet = "jupiter"
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT] Tasks
> 1. Write some comments in your `exercises.js` file
> 2. Create some variables 
> 3. Run your file!
