## if statement

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

```js
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

// make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
  console.log(greeting);
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT] JavaScript is case-sensitive
> Note that `if` is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error.
