It's good to have a go at inspecting the data you get back from an API request. In Javascript, you may need to use array or dictionary accesses in order to fully access this data.

> A dictionary, written with curly braces `{}`, can be accessed with strings.

> The dictionary
> ```js
> let dict = {data: "hello"}
> ```
> can be accessed with `dict["data"]`.


# Try it yourself

- Pick an API from the list in the API page, or use our meow facts API: `https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/` (you can find documentation [here](https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts)), and try various different requests to see how the API responds.
- Find out what happens when you pass an API invalid query parameters.
