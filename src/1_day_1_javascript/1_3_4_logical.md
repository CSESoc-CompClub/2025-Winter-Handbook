## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
Given that `x = 6 and y = 3`, the table below explains the logical operators:

| **Operator** | **Description** | **Example**                   |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| &&           | and             | (x < 10 && y > 1) is true     |
| \|\|         | or              | (x == 5 \|\| y == 5) is false |
| !            | not             | !(x == y) is true             |
