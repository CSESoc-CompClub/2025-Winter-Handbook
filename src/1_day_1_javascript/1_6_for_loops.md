# For Loops

A `for` loop repeats a block of code a known number of times. It’s commonly used when the number of iterations is known ahead of time.

```js
for (initialization; condition; final-expression) {
  // code block to be executed
}

// This loop prints numbers from 0 to 9:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
}
// Output:
// The number is 0
// The number is 1
// The number is 2
// The number is 3
// The number is 4
// The number is 5
// The number is 6
// The number is 7
// The number is 8
// The number is 9

// This loop prints even numbers up to 10:
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output:
// 0
// 2
// 4
// 6
// 8
// 10
```
> [!QUESTION] Question
In a for loop, what are the three parts inside the parentheses used for?

Can you explain what i++ or i += 2 means in simple words?

> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
1. Create a for loop that counts from 1 to 5 and prints each number
2. Create another loop that prints out only odd numbers from 1 to 9
3. Try changing the start or stop number, does the loop still work?
4. Print a fun message with each number, like: "Counting... 1", "Counting... 2", etc.
