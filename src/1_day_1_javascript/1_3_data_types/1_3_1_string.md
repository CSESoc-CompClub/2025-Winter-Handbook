## JavaScript String

A string represents textual data. It contains a sequence of characters. For example, "hello", "JavaScript", etc. In JavaScript, strings are surrounded by quotes:

```js
// string enclosed within single quotes
let fruit = "apple";
console.log(fruit);

// string enclosed within double quotes
let state = "NSW";
console.log(country);

// string enclosed within backticks
let result = `success`;
console.log(result);
```
