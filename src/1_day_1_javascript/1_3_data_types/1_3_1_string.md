# 3.1 - JavaScript Strings

> [!INFO] Strings
> A string represents **textual** data. It contains a sequence of characters. For example, "hello", "JavaScript", etc. In
> JavaScript, strings are surrounded by quotes:
> ```js
> // string enclosed within single quotes
> let fruit = "apple";
> console.log(fruit);
> 
> // string enclosed within double quotes
> let state = "NSW";
> console.log(country);
> 
> // string enclosed within backticks
> let result = `success`;
> console.log(result);
> ```

> [!CAUTION] Mismatched Quotes
> You cannot mismatch quotes in strings. For example, the strings `'hello"` and `"world'` are enclosed inside one single quote and one double quote, which results in an error.

> [!INFO] String Methods
> You can do a whole bunch of things with strings as well! Here are some examples:
> ```js
> // string.length() returns the length of the string
> let fruit = "apple";
> console.log(fruit.length()); // prints 5
> 
> // string.toLowerCase() returns the string in all lowercase letters
> let state = "NSW";
> console.log(country.toLowerCase()); // prints nsw 
> 
> // string.concat() combines 2 strings together
> let descriptor = "super";
> let result = "success!";
> console.log(descriptor + result); // prints super success!
> ```
> You can see a full list of string methods with this link: [https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp)

> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
> 1. Create some variables that contain strings
> 2. Use 3 different string methods on them. Then `console.log()` the result.
