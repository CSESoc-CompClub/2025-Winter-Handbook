# 3.2 - JavaScript Numbers

> [!INFO] Numbers
> In JavaScript, the **number** type represents numeric values (both integers and floating-point numbers).
> 
> 1. Integers - Numeric values **without** any decimal parts. Example: 3, -74, etc.
> 2. Floating-Point - Numeric values **with** decimal parts. Example: 3.15, -1.3, etc.
> 
> ```js
> // Integer value
> let integer_number = -3;
> console.log(integer_number);
> 
> // Floating-point value
> let float_number = 3.15;
> console.log(float_number);
> ```

> [!CAUTION] Too large!
> Numbers are restricted in how large they can be.
> ```js
> let numApples = 9999999999999999; // y will be 10000000000000000
> let numBananas = 999999999999999; // x will be 999999999999999
> ```

> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
> 1. Create some variables that a variety of numbers - be sure to have at least one integer and at least one floating point!
