## Loops – for of

The `for…of` loop iterates over the **values** of an **iterable** object (arrays, strings, Maps, Sets, etc.).

```js
let nums = [45, 52, 3, 5, 10, 11];

for (number of nums) {
  console.log(number);  // Prints the value
}
// Output:
// 45
// 52
// 3
// 5
// 10
// 11
```
> [!NOTE] Use case
> Use `for…of` when you need direct access to the elements of an iterable.
> If you need the indexes of an array, a traditional for loop or `array.entries()` is a better choice.
> To iterate over object properties, use `for…in` or `Object.keys()` / `Object.entries()`.

> [!QUESTION] Question
> What’s the main difference between `for...in` and `for...of`?
> Which one would you use if you wanted to loop over a string’s characters?

> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
> 1. Create an array of 5 hobbies or interests.
> 2. Use `for...of` to print each one.
> 3. Try the same thing with a string (e.g. "hello") and print each letter.
> 4. Try mixing it up: can you figure out how to get both index and value? (Hint: use .entries() with for...of!)
> Bonus: Compare the output of `for...in` vs `for...of` on the same array!
