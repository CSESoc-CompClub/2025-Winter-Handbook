# 4.4 - Logical Operators

> [!INFO] Logical Operators
> Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

> Given that `x = 6 and y = 3`, the table below explains the logical operators:
> | **Operator** | **Description** | **Example**                   |
> | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
> | &&           | and             | (x < 10 && y > 1) is true     |
> | \|\|         | or              | (x == 5 \|\| y == 5) is false |
> | !            | not             | !(x == y) is true             |

> [!SUCCESS] Your Turn: Logical Operators Task
> 1. Create two boolean variables `isRaining` and `hasRaincoat` and set them to either `true` or `false`. What you pick is up to you!
> 2. Print the value of `isRaining AND hasRaincoat`
> 3. Print the value of `isRaining OR hasRaincoat`
> 4. Print the value of `NOT(isRaining AND hasRaincoat)`
