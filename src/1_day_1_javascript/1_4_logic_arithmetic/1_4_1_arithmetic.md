# 4.1 - Math with Arithmetic Operators

> [!INFO] Arithmetic Operators
> There are multiple ways we can operate on numbers, just like in math!
> | **Operator** | **Meaning**                                                     | **Example**                   |
> | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
> | +            | Addition: Adds two values                                       | let add = 250 + 170;          |
> | -            | Subtraction: Minuses one value from another                     | let sub = 500 - 80;           |
> | \*           | Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers                          | let mul = 5 \* 8;             |
> | /            | Division: Divides one number by another                         | let splitCandy = 100 / 12;    |
> | %            | Modulo: Returns the remainder of dividing one number by another | let leftOverCandy = 100 % 12; |

> [!INFO] The Modulo % Operator
> The modulo operator is a little complicated when first seeing it, but once you understand that it's all about
> **remainders**, it's not so bad!
> ```js
> x = 21;
> console.log(x % 4); // 21 รท 4 = 5 remainder 1, so this will print 1
> ```
> Another big use for the modulo operator is by checking whether a number is **odd or even**. We can do this by doing `x % 2` - an odd number has a remainder when divided by 2, whilst an even number has no remainder!

> [!SUCCESS] Your Turn: Arithmetic Operators Task
> 1. Create two number variables `x, y` and set it to any value you like!
> 2. Print the value of x **added** to y
> 3. Print the value of x and y **multiplied** together
> 4. Print the value of x **divided** by y
> 5. Print the **remainder** when x is divided by y
