# 4.3 - Comparison Operators

> [!INFO] Comparison Operators
> Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
> Given that `x = 5`, the table below explains the comparison operators:
> 
> | **Operator** | **Description**          | **Comparison** |
> | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- |
> | ===          | equal to                 | x === 5 (true) |
> | !==          | not equal                | x !== 8 (true) |
> | >            | greater than             | x > 8 (false)  |
> | <            | less than                | x < 8 (true)   |
> | >=           | greater than or equal to | x >= 8 (false) |
> | <=           | less than or equal to    | x <= 8 (true)  |

> [!IMPORTANT] Triple Equals Sign
> In JavaScript we use the triple equals sign (===) instead of double equals sign (==). This is called strict equality and is used for checking that both sides have the same type.

> [!SUCCESS] Your Turn: Comparison Operators Task
> We have these two variables:
> ```js
> let sweetCandy = 100;
> let sourCandy = 150;
> ```
> Find the answers to these questions using JavaScript comparison!
> 1. Is the number of sweet candies greater than the number of sour candies?
> 2. Is the number of sour candies less than or equal to the number of sour candies?
