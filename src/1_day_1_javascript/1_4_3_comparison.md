## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:

| **Operator** | **Description**          | **Comparison** |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| ===          | equal to                 | x === 5 (true) |
| !==          | not equal                | x !== 8 (true) |
| >            | greater than             | x > 8 (false)  |
| <            | less than                | x < 8 (true)   |
| >=           | greater than or equal to | x >= 8 (false) |
| <=           | less than or equal to    | x <= 8 (true)  |

> [!IMPORTANT] Triple Equals Sign
> Notice that we are using triple equals sign (===) instead of double equals sign (==). This is called strict equality and is used for checking that both sides have the same type.
