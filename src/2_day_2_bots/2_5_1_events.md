# Events and Listeners



> [!IMPORTANT] What's an Event?
> An event is something that happens in your Discord server, like someone sending a message, joining a voice call, or a new user joining.
> When you want your bot to notice when these things happen, you can use listeners!

> [!INFO] Listeners = Bot Ears
> Listeners are like the eyes and ears of your bot. They listen for certain events, and when they "hear" one, you can tell your bot to do something, like send a reply or welcome a new member!

> [!TIP]
> All code for events is to be put in its own file, in the `events` folder.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Suppose you want a bot to repeat every message.
> ```javascript
> import { Events } from 'discord.js';
> 
> const name = Events.MessageCreate;
> const once = false;
> function execute(message) {
>   // Prevent the bot from copying its own messages or other bots
>   if (message.author.bot) return;
> 
>   // Send the same content back to the channel
>   message.channel.send(message.content);
> }
> 
> export { name, once, execute };
> ```
> 
> Here, `Events.MessageCreate` is the event, which triggers when someone sends a message in the server.
>
> The value `once` has been set to false, as we want this event to trigger more than just one time.
> 
> If you want your bot to run something only once (the first time only), you can set `once` to `true`. An example can be seen in `clientReady.js`, which prints a message in the terminal once when starting the bot.


> [!INFO] There are many events!
> Your bot can listen for many events, like messages, member joins, reactions, and more!
> 
> Want to see them all? In VSCode, if you type `Events.` (with the dot), you will see a long list.
>
> Or, you can visit [the official discord.js website](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:class) for more information. In the **Events** section, each event has a description of how it triggers, and what information your bot will receive.

> [!SUCCESS] Try This!
> Your task is to make your bot react to a message with an emoji 👋 when someone says "hello".
> 1. Create a new file in the `events` folder called `hello.js`.
> 2. The bot should listen to every message
> 3. The bot should be able to run many times
> 4. It should check if a message contains the word "hello", and react to the message if so.

> [!HINT]
> You can check if a message contains a word by checking if `message.content.includes('word')`

> [!HINT]
> You can react to a message using `message.react('👋')` (can copy the emoji).
