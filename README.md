Use callouts like so: https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-callouts

You will need to have rust and run `cargo install mdbook`and `cargo install mdbook-callouts`
if you don't have the packages already.

To build, open the book and have it auto-update on save, do ``mdbook serve --open``.

Alternatively, you can also use ``mdbook build --open``.

**Make sure you are working and merging into the CORRECT BRANCH!!** 
E.g. day 1 people should be merging into the day-1 branch. No merging into main just yet. We will merge all the day branches once everything is finished.
