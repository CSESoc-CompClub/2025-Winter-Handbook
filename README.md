Use callouts like so: https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-callouts

You will need to have rust and run `cargo install mdbook`and `cargo install mdbook-callouts`
if you don't have the packages already.

To build, open the book and have it auto-update on save, do ``mdbook serve --open``.

Alternatively, you can also use ``mdbook build --open``.

**Make sure you are NOT merging directly into master!!**
